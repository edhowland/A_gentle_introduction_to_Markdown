### Nested lists

To nest a list within another list, indent it by 4 spaces.

<pre>
- First item 
- Second item 
- Third item 
    * Indented item 
    * Indented item 
- Fourth item  column 1
</pre>

Becomes:

- First item 
- Second item 
- Third item 
    * Indented item 
    * Indented item 
- Fourth item  column 1


Note: We mixed '-' and '*' to visually distinguish between nesting levels.

### Ordered lists

Ordered lists use numbers followed by a period: '.'
They can be out of sequence, but must start with : '1.'



<pre>
1. List number 1
2. List number 2
3. List number 3
4. List number 4
</pre>

Becomes:


1. List number 1
2. List number 2
3. List number 3
4. List number 4
