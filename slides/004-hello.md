## Comments

All writers and programmers should know how insert comments in their source
documents and code. Comments are for the author and future maintainers
of the source file and will not appear in the compiled output.

<pre>
[//]: # (This text should not appear in the output)

Note: Be sure to include a blank line both before and after the comment line.

***
[//]: # (This text should not appear in the output)
