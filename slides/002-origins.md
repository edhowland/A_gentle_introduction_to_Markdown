# Introduction to the Markdown text format

## Origins

Markdown was proposed in 2004 by John Gruber of the "Daring Fireball" blog fame
in collaboration with Arron Swartz a programmer and Open Source advocate.

## Variants and standardization efforts

Many attempts to implement Markdown processors have lead to a plethora of
somewhat incompatible variants. Attempts to standardize these into a common
format have been met with less than stellar results
