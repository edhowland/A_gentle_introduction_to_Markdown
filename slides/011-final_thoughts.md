## Displaying Markdown in your terminal

You can use the 'glow'  application to pretty print your Markdown files in
from the  command line.

### Installation

See the main source page on github.com for install directions:

[Glow on Github](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow)

[Glow binary releases](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow/releases)

Then try this to see this page:

```
$ glow 011-final_thoughts.md
```

### Use 'bat' 

Bat is a drop-in replacement for the 'cat' utility written in Rust with many
features like syntax highlighting. Bat supports Markdown files natively.

#### Installation

[Bat on Github](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)

Then:

```
$ bat -l markdown 011-final_thoughts.md
```





## Github

If you create a new project on github.com, and choose the "Add a README"
option, you can immediately clone the repository and begin working on it.
It will have a file "README.md" in the project root folder. Likewise, creating
such a file in your existing project will cause it to be rendered as HTML
on the project's home page. This also works for a file named "README.markdown".
