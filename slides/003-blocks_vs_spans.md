# Blocks vs. Spans

## The Flow model of document layout

A flow is text laid out the natural way you would write within a box.
It "flows" from left to right wrapping the word upon reaching the right edge
and starting back the left edge one line further down.

### Text spans

A span does not interrupt the natural flow of the text layout.
It is applied to text within the current flow. Examples include:

- Underlines
- Bold
- Italic

### Blocks

Unlike a text span, a block does actually interrupt the text flow. It acts as a
hard break, resetting the flow back to left edge and down some vertical amount.
