## Github

If you create a new project on github.com, and choose the "Add a README"
option, you can immediately clone the repository and begin working on it.
It will have a file "README.md" in the project root folder. Likewise, creating
such a file in your existing project will cause it to be rendered as HTML
on the project's home page. This also works for a file named "README.markdown".
