<h1>A Gentle Introduction to Markdown</h1>

<h2>What?</h2>

<p>Since its introduction 16 years ago, the Markdown text format has become ubiquitous in the software world and in IT in general.
Its adoption across the Open Source landscape, in particular, has made it a priority for users, maintainers and contributors alike. Even though Markdown is a simplified Rich Text Format (RTF), it does require some knowledge about how to accomplish even basic tasks.
We will start with a simple example and build it into a complete Markdown document.
Hopefully, we will have learned how to create our own Markdown documents, make changes to open source documentation and participate more fully in social media forums.
This tutorial might show factors common with both personal and enterprise computing.</p>
