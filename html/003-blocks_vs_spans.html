<h1>Blocks vs. Spans</h1>

<h2>The Flow model of document layout</h2>

<p>A flow is text laid out the natural way you would write within a box.
It "flows" from left to right wrapping the word upon reaching the right edge
and starting back the left edge one line further down.</p>

<h3>Text spans</h3>

<p>A span does not interrupt the natural flow of the text layout.
It is applied to text within the current flow. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Underlines</li>
<li>Bold</li>
<li>Italic</li>
</ul>

<h3>Blocks</h3>

<p>Unlike a text span, a block does actually interrupt the text flow. It acts as a
hard break, resetting the flow back to left edge and down some vertical amount.</p>
