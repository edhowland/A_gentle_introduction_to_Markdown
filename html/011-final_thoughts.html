<h2>Github</h2>

<p>If you create a new project on github.com, and choose the "Add a README"
option, you can immediately clone the repository and begin working on it.
It will have a file "README.md" in the project root folder. Likewise, creating
such a file in your existing project will cause it to be rendered as HTML
on the project's home page. This also works for a file named "README.markdown".</p>

<h2>How was it made?</h2>

<p>This slide deck was made using  multiple Markdown files and then
converted to XHTML using the original Markdown.pl Perl script written by John
Gruber</p>

<h2>Cheat Sheet</h2>

<p>The next slide is a downloaded Markdown Cheat Sheet  from<a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/">The Markdown Guide:https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/</a> </p>
